# **Divide and Conquer**

The "divide and conquer" paradigm for algorithm design is centered around the idea of taking one big problem and dividing it (typically through recursion) into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
Cormen outlines the three main steps of recursive calls in "divide and conquer" algorithms:
* **Divide** the problem into smaller subproblems
* **Conquer** the subproblems through recursive calls (or directly if the problem is sufficiently small)
* **Combine** the solutions of the subproblems to form a solution for the bigger problem

The most classic example of "divide and conquer" algorithms is merge sort. Here i will outline the divide, conquer and combine steps present in merge sort.
