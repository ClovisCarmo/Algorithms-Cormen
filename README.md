# Algorithms-Cormen
My name is Cl√≥vis Carmo, i am an undergraduate CS student at Universidade Federal da Bahia in Brazil. This repository contains my journey through learning data structures and algorithms with "Introduction to Algorithms" (Cormen et al).  Here i share my implementations of the algorithms and data structures, as well as my studying notes. I hope this can help anyone who might be starting out their own journey through learning DSA.
